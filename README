# Final Project: AI Models for Camper Preferences

This project is developed as part of the **Introduction to AI** course.
The script processes a file containing campers' preferences and allows you to sample data from it,
then run a specified AI model for a given number of iterations.
The available models are: `base-line`, `csp` (Constraint Satisfaction Problem), and `genetic`.

## Usage

To run the script, use the following command format:
python script.py <filename> [-m MODEL] [-s SAMPLES] [-i ITERATIONS]
when:
MODEL is one of 'base-line', 'csp', or 'genetic
SAMPLES is a number between 100 and the total number of campers in the file
ITERATIONS a positive value.

Note: we test the script with 10 iterations or 1 keep in mind that 10 iterations for the genetic algorithm can
take a couple of minutes to run even for 100 campers so be patient
