## 📚 **Project Description**

This project was developed as part of the **Introduction to AI** course. It focuses on processing a dataset containing campers' preferences and running various AI models to simulate how those preferences might be optimized. The available models are:

- **Base-line model**  
- **Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP)**  
- **Genetic Algorithm**

### Main Features:
- Allows sampling of camper preferences data from the file.
- Runs selected AI models for a specified number of iterations.
- Supports flexible configuration of the number of samples and iterations.

### Main Components:
- Data processing and sampling from campers' preferences.
- Execution of AI models with varying configurations.

### Technologies:
- Python
- Constraint Satisfaction Problem algorithms
- Genetic Algorithms

## ⚡ **Getting Started**

To get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine, follow the instructions below.

---

## 🧱 **Prerequisites**

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: 
  - `numpy`
  - `pandas`
  - `argparse`

---

## 🏗️ **Installing**

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/camper-preferences.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:  
   ```bash
   cd camper-preferences
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## 🧪 **Testing**

You can run tests by executing:

```bash
python test_script.py
```

This test will check whether the script correctly samples data, processes the file, and runs the specified AI models for the given number of iterations.

---

## 🚀 **Deployment**

To deploy the project, no special setup is required. Simply run the script on a local machine using the following command format:

```bash
python script.py <filename> [-m MODEL] [-s SAMPLES] [-i ITERATIONS]
```

Where:
- `MODEL` is one of 'base-line', 'csp', or 'genetic'.
- `SAMPLES` is a number between 100 and the total number of campers.
- `ITERATIONS` is a positive integer.

---

## ⚙️ **Built With**

- **Python** - The main language used in development.
- **Genetic Algorithm** - For solving optimization problems.
- **CSP Algorithm** - For solving constraint satisfaction problems.

- Libraries such as `numpy`, `pandas`, and `argparse` played a key role in this project.



# Final Project: AI Models for Camper Preferences

This project is developed as part of the **Introduction to AI** course.
The script processes a file containing campers' preferences and allows you to sample data from it,
then run a specified AI model for a given number of iterations.
The available models are: `base-line`, `csp` (Constraint Satisfaction Problem), and `genetic`.

## Usage

To run the script, use the following command format:
python script.py <filename> [-m MODEL] [-s SAMPLES] [-i ITERATIONS]
when:
MODEL is one of 'base-line', 'csp', or 'genetic
SAMPLES is a number between 100 and the total number of campers in the file
ITERATIONS a positive value.

Note: we test the script with 10 iterations or 1 keep in mind that 10 iterations for the genetic algorithm can
take a couple of minutes to run even for 100 campers so be patient
